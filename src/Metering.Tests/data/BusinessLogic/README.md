# README

The different directories here contain a series of events and the resulting state / snapshots. 

- **Sequence Number**: The files begin with the decimal sequence number (starting with `000`), 
- **File Type**: whether the JSON file contains an `event` or `state`. 
- **Timestamp**: The event files also contain the timestamp on when they arrived in EventHub, in the form `yyyy-MM-dd--hh-mm-ss`.
- For illustrative purposes, the event file can also contain some comment.
